## Cesium Typescript Documentation Generation
in src/S-Innovations.Cesium.TypescriptGenerator you will find a command line tool, or atleast the very first version of it, that will generate valid typescript definitions for all of Cesium Classes that are exported on their Documentation site:

https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Documentation/index.html

The result can be found in the artifacts folder.
